# RNAseq_tutorial
1st Summer School of Bioinformatics, February 15-19th 2016

Learning objectives of this "hands-on" part of the course:
+ Provide a working example of RNAseq raw-data analysis pipeline  
+ Run major analysis steps in a reasonable amount of time with modest computer resources  
+ Get familiar with command-line based softwares  
+ Get familiar with major file formats (inputs and outputs)  
+ Get familiar with gene expression estimates  
+ Discuss common technical issues related to RNAseq studies  
+ Get help outside of this course  

This tutorial includes:  
+ Softwares to install: not all softwares will necessarily presented     
+ Files to download: see analysis pipeline for "saving files" instructions   
+ Analysis pipeline: based on Tuxedo protocol (Trapnell et al. 2012)
